Hi friends of this awesome mod for the AM8,

due to my interest in using the Voron Tap probe (see https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap) im working on a modification for the AM8-Switchwire-Mod allowing the nearly untouched Tap to be mounted on the X-Carriage.
Furthermore a change to the printbed is required due to the needed rigidity the Tap requires. I'll keep this updated.
